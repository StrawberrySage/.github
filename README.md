# StrawberrySage

This organisation holds some of my Friday Night Funkin' related projects.

The handle used to belong to my personal GitHub account, which I have now changed to [@kitzsh](https://github.com/kitzsh).

I am not abandoning this name yet, nor am I leaving the FNF community. I just wanted to separate my GitHub account from my other online accounts, that's all.
